# Contributing to ClinWiki

## Found a bug?

Bug reports are welcome. Please try to be as specific as possible so we can reproduce the problem.

- Search the existing issues to make sure your bug has not already been reported. If it has consider adding more information in a comment instead of opening a new bug.

- If you are unable to find an existing issue create a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description** and as much relevant information as possible. When possible include a link to the specific page that shows the issue.

- Do not open a bug if study data is wrong. Instead consider _using_ the wiki features to correct or annotate the study.

## Local Development

Ready to fix a bug or add a feature? This section will get a development copy of ClinWiki running on your local Windows/Mac/Linux system in a snap.

The easiest way to start ClinWiki on your own system is to use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- Clone the clinwiki repository
- Install Docker
  - Windows and Mac users install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Linux users follow the [official install instructions for Docker for your distribution](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)
- **Note: if you're using OS X, you will want to run docker-compose commands with `-f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-osx.yml`**. Install `docker-sync` via `gem install docker-sync` and then run `docker-sync start --config=docker-sync.yml` in a separate terminal. This will fix file mounting issues in OS X and Docker that create significant performance problems using the default config.
- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up` or `docker-compose up -d` to run as daemon in background
- `compose/bin/search_bootstrap`
- Now you should have the ClinWiki server running on http://localhost:3000
- Extras
  - Logs: `docker-compose logs -f clinwiki`
  - Console: `docker-compose exec clinwiki bundle exec rails c`
  - Run and build: `docker-compose up -d --build`
    The front end is not built yet so you will only see the rails start page but you can browse to http://localhost:3000/graphiql to send graphql queries.
- cd /front
  - yarn install
  - yarn start
  - This will build the ClinWiki front end and serve it on http://localhost:3001
  - Changes to local .ts/.tsx files will be automatically applied to the running system

### CW_MODE

You can use the CW_MODE environment variable to configure how docker-compose starts ClinWiki.

- CW_MODE=PROD - the default, builds the front end and runs rails
- CW*MODE=FAST - runs rails \_without* building the front end for a quicker startup
- CW_MODE=DEV - starts the 'clinwiki' container without running rails so you can start/restart it manually during development
- CW_MODE=WORKER - runs the sidekiq process instead of rails

To specify the variable changes the command line a little bit depending on if you're on Windows or Linux/Mac:

_Linux/Mac:_

```
CW_MODE=FAST docker-compose up -d
```

_Windows:_

```
set CW_MODE=FAST
docker-compose up -d
```

## Branch Strategy

```
master ◀ staging ◀ feature 1
                 ◀ feature 2
                 ◀ feature 3
```

The master branch is always in a ready to deploy state and matches what is running on https://www.clinwiki.org.

Weekly completed feature branches are merged to the staging branch and then staging is deployed to https://staging.clinwiki.org and manual tests are run to ensure no regressions from the previous version. The only time it makes sense to commit directly to the staging branch is to fix small bugs found during this testing phase. Once testing is complete staging gets pulled to master and deployed.

To contribute a new feature or bug fix create a new branch off of the current staging (or master) and implement the feature. Then open a pull request to the staging branch.

- If the pull request is only for review but not quite ready yet prepend "WIP" or "work in progress" to the front of the title so it doesn't get accidently merged on merge day.
- Add a new entry to ReleaseNotes/index.tsx describing your change or bugfix. Don't worry too much about having the "right" version as we will fix it up when it merges to staging.

## Admin

To access the sub-site config and bulk update admin features, add admin role after creating a user
In rails console, User.find_by(email: "[email of the user]").add_role(:admin)

## Working with Sites

Sites can be accessed locally by navigating to a subdomain against your localhost.
By default, `http://mysite.localhost:3001` and `http://test.localhost:3001` are
white-listed for CORS requests. This means you can configure a site with the subdomain
`mysite` and a site with the subdomain `test` without additional CORS configuration.

# Testing

ClinWiki is working on increasing unit test coverage.

We have a manual checklist maintained in the Wiki that
we will run though after features are merged to staging.
[See it here](https://github.com/clinwiki-org/clinwiki/wiki/Testing-Guide)

## Running Ruby Tests

```bash
# ensure your test database exists.
# you should only need to run this once.
# you'll want to re-migrate the test database
# when new migrations appear
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

bundle exec rspec spec
```

The test database is automatically configured
in `config/environments/test.rb'
